\section{Unique Fixed-Point in an Interval}
	
	\begin{equation}
		g(x) = \frac{1}{2}e^{0.5x},[0,1]
	\label{eq:32}
	\end{equation}
		
	First, it is necessary to check if $g(x)$ is an element of $[a,b]$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. Starting with $x = a = 0$:
	
	\begin{align}
		g(0) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{0.5*0}& &;&
		g(0) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{0}& &;&
		g(0) &= \frac{1}{2}& &;&
		g(0) &= 0.5&
	\label{eq:320x}
	\end{align}

	Since $0.5$ is an element of $[a,b]$, the next step is to check with $x = b = 1$:

	\begin{align}
		g(1) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{0.5*1}& &;&
		g(1) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{0.5}& &;&
		g(1) &= 0.5*1.6487& &;&
		g(1) &= 0.8244&
	\label{eq:321x}
	\end{align}

	Since $0.8244$ an element of $[a,b]$, it is correct to assume the \cref{eq:32} can have at least one fixed-point on the indicated interval if it is monotone. Derivating \cref{eq:32}:

	\begin{align}
		g(x) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{0.5x}& \notag \\
		g'(x) &= \frac{1}{2}*e^{0.5x}*\frac{1}{2}& \notag \\
		g'(x) &= \frac{1}{4}*e^{0.5x}&
	\label{eq:32derivate}
	\end{align}

	Looking at the \cref{eq:32derivate}, it is correct to affirm that the \cref{eq:32} is monotone. The \cref{eq:32} have at least one fixed-point.

	To prove the uniqueness it is necessary to guarantee that $|g'(x)| < 1$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. Starting with $x = a = 0$:

	\begin{align}
		g'(0) &= \frac{1}{4}*e^{0.5*0}& &;&
		g'(0) &= 0.25&
	\label{eq:32derivate0x}
	\end{align}

	Since $0.25 < 1$, the next step is to check $g'(x)$ with $x = b = 1$:

	\begin{align}
		g'(1) &= \frac{1}{4}*e^{0.5*1}& &;&
		g'(1) &= 0.4122&
	\label{eq:32derivate1x}
	\end{align}

	Since $0.4122 < 1$, and $0.4122$ is the maximum value in $[a,b]$, we can affirm that \cref{eq:32} have an unique fixed-point.
