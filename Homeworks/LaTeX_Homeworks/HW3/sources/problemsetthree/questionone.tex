\section{Fixed-Points in an Interval}

	\textbf{Note}: How can I check if $g(x)$ is an element of $[a,b]$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$? Checking only $a$ and $b$ do not guarantee for all $x$, only the bounds.
	
	\subsection{Question (a)}
	
	\begin{equation}
		g(x) = \frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{x}{2}},[4,5]
	\label{eq:31a}
	\end{equation}
	
	First, it is necessary to check if $g(x)$ is an element of $[a,b]$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. Starting with $x = a = 4$:
	
	\begin{align}
		g(4) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{4}{2}}& &;&
		g(4) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2}& &;&
		g(4) &= 3.6945&
	\label{eq:31a4x}
	\end{align}

	Since $3.6945$ is not an element of $[a,b]$, it is not possible to guarantee that the \cref{eq:31a} have at least one fixed-point on the indicated interval.

	\subsection{Question (b)}
	
	\begin{equation}
		g(x) = \frac{1}{5}\cos(x),\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]
	\label{eq:31b}
	\end{equation}
	
	First, it is necessary to check if $g(x)$ is an element of $[a,b]$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. Starting with $x = a = 0$:
	
	\begin{align}
		g(0) &= \frac{1}{5}\cos(0)& &;&
		g(0) &= 0.2&
	\label{eq:31b0x}
	\end{align}

	Since $0$ is an element of $[a,b]$, the next step is to check with $x = b = \frac{\pi}{2}$:

	\begin{align}
		g\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= \frac{1}{5}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)& &;& 
		g\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= 1.2246 * 10^{-17}&
	\label{eq:31bpix}
	\end{align}

	Since $1.2246 * 10^{-17}$ an element of $[a,b]$, it is correct to assume the \cref{eq:31b} can have at least one fixed-point on the indicated interval if it is monotone. Derivating \cref{eq:31b}:

	\begin{align}
		g(x) &= \frac{1}{5}\cos(x)& \notag \\
		g'(x) &= -\frac{1}{5}\sin(x)& 
		\label{eq:31bderivate}
	\end{align}

	Looking at the \cref{eq:31bderivate}, it is correct to affirm that the \cref{eq:31b} is not monotone. It is necessary to confirm if the \cref{eq:31bderivate} is not monotone with $x$ in the range of $[a,b]$. Starting with $x = a = 0$:

	\begin{align}
		g'(0) &= -\frac{1}{5}\sin(0)& &;&
		g'(0) &= 0&
	\label{eq:31bderivatepix}
	\end{align}

	And with $x = b = \frac{\pi}{2}$:

	\begin{align}
		g'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= -\frac{1}{5}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)& &;&
		g'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) &= -0.2&
	\label{eq:31bderivatepix}
	\end{align}

	Since $g'(x)$ with $x$ in $[a,b]$ is nonincreasing, the \cref{eq:31b} is monotone. With this argument, it is correct to affirm that the \cref{eq:31b} have at least one fixed-point.
